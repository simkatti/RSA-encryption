## Week 1 report

### Hours used this week
20

### What I've done this week
This week I chose the project, studied the required algorithms, thought about the program architecture, initialised the project and did the GUI.

### How the project has developed this week
The project is initialised with poetry. I also finished the GUI (with heavy debugging with AI) added autopep8 and pylint.

### What I learnt this week
I learnt about Miller-Rabins algorithm and have an overall picture how to do the program. I also learnt how to use tkinter since it was my first time building any kind of GUI.

### What challanges I faced this week
Was stuck for hours working and debugging the GUI. It should work now. No other challanges.

### What I will do next week
Next week I will start with the Miller-Rabin large prime number algorithm as I think it's the most challenging part and will require a lot of work. I will also do tests for however much I get done next week and add CI's in github actions (unittest, pylint)
