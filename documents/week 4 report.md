## Week 4 report

### Hours used this week


### What I've done this week
- Better test values! The tests now use big primes generated by the program(1024bits) and random size primes that are 500-2000 bits. The tests also use their multiples as composite numbers. This made running the tests really slow so I only generated 10 big primes and 10 primes with random sizes. The tests take 3-4min to run. 
- Implimented tests for decryptor
- Intergration test makes sure the input message is same as the output. 
- Testing document

### How the project has developed this week
- Finished the tests, maybe(?)

### What I learnt this week


### What challanges I faced this week


Questions:
1. How much of the code should be documented? It all seems obvious to me so I am not sure how much it should be commented.
2. I don't really know what to with the program since the tests and program is done so is there any way I could improve it more apart from documentation? (I am aiming for grade 5)
3. Must the instruction document be a separate document or is it fine if the instructions are on the readme.md?

### What I will do next week
Write documents, peer review and fix program if needed.
