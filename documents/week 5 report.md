## Week 5 repost

### Hours used this week
+30

### What I've done this week
- Fixed the test inputs. I made separate files with large primes that I found [here](https://t5k.org/curios/index.php?start=143&stop=700). That should be ok now
- Did peer review
- Implimented padding and tests for it
- Updated docs

### How the project has developed this week
A lot, i think its almost ready. Just needs little tweaks here and there

### What I learnt this week (or what im trying to learn this week)
How padding works

### What challanges I faced this week
The padding caused a lot of grey hairs this week specially handing the byte strings. However it should work now.

### What I will do next week
Not much honestly I've had too much fun with this project and have totally neglected my other school work.
